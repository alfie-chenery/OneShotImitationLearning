trian a policy with mimic gen
get it learning a task, remember this policy

Try policy on new task
add noise to the policy
  dont use random noise - not repeatable
  eg add fixed velocity a every time step
  
see how much noise is required before it can do it

repeat for new objects

maybe limit to 4 degrees of freedom
(3 degrees
