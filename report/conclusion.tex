\chapter{Conclusion}


%TODO think about where we actually want this section. Dont want to end with it because it leaves the wrong impression to the reader.
\section{Future Work}
\begin{itemize}
    \item multi stage demos, object of interest changes whenever gripper opens or closes. Talk about how we could make the system accept multi step demos

    \item segmentation map, we have a segmentation map available but dont use it. We could use it to prevent keypoints matching to different objects such as background noise. Would improve robustness with nouse images. However, the perfect seg map is because we in simulation. A real world one would probably be more vision transformer stuff which is not waht we want in this paper.
